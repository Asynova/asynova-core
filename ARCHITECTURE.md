# What's Open Source vs Proprietary

## ðŸ”“ Open Source (This Repository)

### Basic Optimization Concepts
- Simple exact-match caching
- Elementary prompt compression (remove common words)
- Rule-based model selection (length-based)
- Basic examples and documentation

### What It Achieves
- 10-20% cost reduction for typical use cases
- Good for small projects and learning
- Proves that AI cost optimization is possible
- Free forever under MIT license

## ðŸ”’ Proprietary (Asynova Platform)

### Advanced Algorithms
- **Semantic Deduplication**: Vector embeddings with cosine similarity
- **ML Cost Prediction**: Pattern recognition and predictive analytics  
- **Context-Aware Compression**: NLP-based optimization
- **Intelligent Model Routing**: Complexity assessment algorithms

### Enterprise Infrastructure
- Multi-tenant architecture (94 database tables)
- Real-time cost tracking and analytics
- Multi-agent workflow orchestration
- Team collaboration features
- SSO, audit logs, compliance features

### What It Achieves
- **60% guaranteed cost reduction**
- Handles millions of requests/day
- Enterprise-grade reliability
- 24/7 support with SLA

## Why This Split Makes Sense

1. **Trust**: Open source proves we're not making empty claims
2. **Education**: Developers learn the concepts for free
3. **Business**: Advanced features fund continued development
4. **Community**: Basic version helps everyone save something

## The Bottom Line

- **Use Open Source**: If you're learning or have <1000 API calls/month
- **Use Platform**: If you're serious about reducing AI costs

Start with the open source version. When you outgrow it (usually within a week), upgrade to the platform.
